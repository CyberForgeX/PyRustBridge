# PyRustBridge

PyRustBridge offers a seamless integration between Python's dynamic and high-level capabilities and Rust's unparalleled performance and safety. This project is designed for developers looking to enhance their Python applications with the speed of Rust, providing an efficient way to handle performance-critical tasks.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Utilize Rust's performance within your Python applications.
- **Easy Integration**: A straightforward interface between Python and Rust components.
- **Automatic Dependency Management**: Dynamic resolution and installation of dependencies.
- **Environment Management**: Utilize Minimamba for clean, reproducible Python environments.
- **Cross-Language Development**: Develop and distribute applications that leverage both Python and Rust.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust: Install Rust and Cargo using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
- Python: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system.
- Minimamba/Conda: Follow the [Minimamba installation guide](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

### Installation

Clone the PyRustBridge repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/PyRustBridge.git

Navigate to the PyRustBridge directory:

bash

cd PyRustBridge

Execute the setup command:

bash

./scripts/setup_environment.sh

This command sets up both the Rust and Python environments, installs all necessary dependencies, and prepares the PyRustBridge package for use.
Usage

After installation, you can import PyRustBridge in your Python code:

python

from PyRustBridge import rust_interface

# Example usage
result = rust_interface.perform_fast_computation(data)

Replace perform_fast_computation with the actual Rust-implemented function you wish to call.
